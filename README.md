## 🛡️ Our Ethos

> "Indeed, Allah has permitted trade and forbidden riba."  
> — *Qur’an, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:275)*

Every algorithm, model, and investment idea is **screened through Qur’anic values**, Hadith, and scholarly consensus. Our goal is to build **Barakah-first algorithms** in a world of bias-driven finance.
